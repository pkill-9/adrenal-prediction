\section{Introduction}
including overview of adrenal tumours, why they are a problem, overview of
the process used to predict malignancy.

\section{Overview of HPC}
room full of servers, managed in house by an organisation
edward at unimelb.

\section{Overview of Cloud Computing}
in this case, IaaS; we get access to a VM, someone else takes care of
keeping it running, backups, maintenance of hardware.
nectar, aws, azure
iaas, paas, saas.

\section{System Architechture}
batch of classifications is broken into two sets, some to run on HPC, the 
rest on cloud.

\section{Performance}
How much time when run sequentially? in parallel? also the time taken to
spawn a new VM, which is not quick. This section will contain experimental
design and results.

\section{Conclusion}
