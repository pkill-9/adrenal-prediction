Octave:
 x = load('norm.mat')
 thus it is the scalar structure,
 while 'this' is 
 this = lvq_classifier('classifier_19steroids.mat')
 and it is also a scalar structure, 
 while a.normalization_values.mean is a matrix



 this = classifier('classifier_19steroids.mat')
 load('norm.mat')
 [x1, x2] = get_distance (this, xi)




 two ways:
 1) use local matlab to preprocess the data and then generate the mat file and sent it to the cloud to calculate
 2) load the data remotely and preprocess and classify on cloud.


use the matlab to call the remote code or call the command
build the web app to handle the data management
